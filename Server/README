USER MANUAL

To compile the program, simply use cd to go into the program directory 
through the command line and then use the make command as shown. 

$ make

The makefile should then compile server.c and create the server executable 
in the same directory.

To use the server, make sure you are in the same directory as the server 
executable and type a command in this format: ./server <portnumber>

For example one valid command is this:

$ ./server 3000

Once this is done the server will do nothing but wait until a client 
connects to it.

To connect to the server using a web browser(e.g. firefox, chrome), 
type a request in this format into the address bar:				
http://<machinename>:<port>/<filename> 

<machinename> is the name or IP address of the server machine 
<port> is the port number that the server is using, <portnumber>
<filename> is the name of the file you want from the server

For example, when testing the server on the same machine, you can use:

http://localhost:3000/hello.html

If the filename requested exists on the same directory as the server 
and is of one of the filetypes listed here (.jpeg, .jpg, .gif, .html, .htm), 
the browser should show the file correctly on the screen. If the file 
does not exist on the server directory, the browser should instead show 
a 404 error page.

Once you are finished using the program, you can use the make clean command 
to remove all extraneous files created during compilation and return 
the program to its original state as shown.

$ make clean

To make a distributable tarball of the program use make dist.

$ make dist
